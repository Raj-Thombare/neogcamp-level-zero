### Start Redis

Let’s start redis locally and start using it as a DB

```html
docker run --name my-redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Connecting to your container and Redis CLI

```html
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash redis-cli
```

### **SET, GET and DELETE Data**

SET mykey “Hello”

GET mykey

DEL mykey

### How would you use it for caching data?

```html
SET tracks "[{title:'typescript', description:''}]"
```

### HSET/HGET/HDEL - (H = HASH)

if you want to store multiple values with same key

```html
HSET user:100 name "Raj Thombare" email "raj@gmail.com" age "22" HGET user:100
name HGET user:100 email HSET tracks:101 "[{title:'typescript',
description:''}]" HGET tracks:101
```

### **Redis as a queue**

Pushing to a Queue

```html
LPUSH problems 1 LPUSH problems 2
```

Popping from a Queue

```html
RPOP problems RPOP problems
```

Blocked pop

```html
BRPOP problems 0 (infinite) BRPOP problems 30
```

The last argument represents the timeout before the blocking should be stopped

```

```
