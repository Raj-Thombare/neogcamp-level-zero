1. Docker Registry - It holds container images that can be distributed to a Docker Engine

---

2. Docker Engine - It’s open-source containerization technology that helps developers package applications into containers

---

3. Container - A container is a running instance of an image. They are isolated. Its just a executable instance of your source code and OS libraries and required dependencies to run the code on your machine

A good mental model for a container is when you run `node index.js` on your machine from some source code you got from github

---

4. Image - A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

A good mental model for an image is `Your codebase on github`

## Container Vs Image

Image contains the source code and every dependency along with os whereas container is just a running instance of an image

## Docker Commands

1. docker kill - to kill running container
2. docker run -p 27017:27018 -d mongo - to run images

   -d to run in detached mode and -p for port mapping

3. docker rmi - to remove image from locally
4. docker ps - view running containers
5. docker images - view images
6. docker build - create your own containers
7. docker start image name - to start
