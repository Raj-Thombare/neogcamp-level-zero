Recoil
Core Concepts
Atom - atom is state units, they subscribe to your components, so whenever any atom’s state updates, it re-renders.
useRecoilValue - returns only value
useRecoilState - returns both set function and value
useSetRecoilState - returns on set function
Selector - selector is derived state from other atom. It takes get as a function and using which you can get access to other atoms state.
const fontSizeLabelState = selector({
key: 'fontSizeLabelState',
get: ({get}) => {
const fontSize = get(fontSizeState);
const unit = 'px';

    return `${fontSize}${unit}`;

},
});
​
Async Queries
Selectors can be used as one way to incorporate asynchronous data into the Recoil data-flow graph.
Selectors represent "idempotent" functions i.e., For a given set of inputs they should always produce the same results.
This is important as selector evaluations may be cached, restarted, or executed multiple times. Because of this, selectors are generally a good way to model read-only DB queries.
If the user names were stored in some database we need to query, all we need to do is return a Promise or use an async function. If any dependencies change, the selector will be re-evaluated and execute a new query. The results are cached, so the query will only execute once per unique input.
—> Query Default Atom Values
If the default values are coming from async operation
export const notificationsAtom = atom({
key: "notificationsAtom",
default: selector({
key: 'notificationsAtom/default',
get: async () => {
const response = await axios.get(
"https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/notifications"
);
return response.data;
}
})
});
//myFunction(){}
//get: () => myFunction()
​
Atom Family
An Atom Family represents a collection of atoms. It let’s you create multiple Atoms.
import { atom, atomFamily } from "recoil";

export const TODOS = [{
    id: 1,
    title: "Go to Gym",
    description: "Hit the gym from 7-9"
}, {
    id: 2,
    title: "Go to eat food",
    description: "Eat food from from 9-11"
}]

export const todosAtomFamily = atomFamily({
    key: 'todosAtomFamily',
    default: (id) => {
        return TODOS.find(x => x.id === id)
    }
})
​
Selector Family
A selectorFamily is a powerful pattern that is similar to a selector, but allows you to pass parameters to the get and set callbacks of a selector. 
To make asynchronous calls, you need selector in an Atom. Similarly, In Atom Family, you need Selector family to get data from server.
In the TODO application, let’s say you are supposed to get TODOs from server.
export const todosAtomFamily = atomFamily({
  key: "todosAtomFamily",
  default: selectorFamily({
    key: "todosSelectorFamily",
    get:
      (id: number) =>
        async () => {
          await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000))
          const res = await axios.get(
            `https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/todo?id=${id}`
          );
          return res.data.todo;
        },
  }),
});
​
useRecoilStateLoadable & useRecoilValueLoadable
This hook is intended to be used for reading the value of asynchronous selectors. This hook will implicitly subscribe the component to the given state.

It returns a Loadable object, which provides information about the current state (loading, hasValue, or hasError) of the atom or selector.
const Todo = ({ id }: TodoProps) => {
const todo = useRecoilValueLoadable(todosAtomFamily(id)); // return only state
const [todo, setTodo]= useRecoilStateLoadable(todosAtomFamily(id)); // return state & setter function
if (todo.state === "loading") {
return <div>Loading...</div>;
} else if (todo.state === "hasValue") {
return (

<>
{todo?.contents.title}
{todo?.contents.description}
<br />
</>
);
} else if (todo.state === "hasError") {
return <div>Error getting data from backend</div>;
}
};
